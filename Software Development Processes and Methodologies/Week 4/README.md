# Software Development Models: Agile and Lean

![Agile Frameworks](https://github.com/ElizaLo/Software-Development-Lifecycle/blob/master/Software%20Development%20Processes%20and%20Methodologies/Week%204/Agile%20Frameworks.png)

- **Scrum**: Scrum is based on this one to four-week cycle where you take part of your project and you do your define, your develop, your design, and you test your software, and so your product is developed incrementally.
- **Kanban**: which is based on a continuous flow model where you basically try to optimize your existing software development process.
- **Scrumban**: where you use _Scrum_ as your primary framework and then you use _Kanban_ to optimize your flow within your sprint.
- **XP**: has most of the practices of Scrum but it also defines some engineering practices which are very crucial for an Agile team. 
- **Hybrid of a Scrum and XP**
- **Lean Startup**: which helps you if you have lot of unpredictable market or industry and you want to really prove your solution before you implement it. So Lean Startup helps you in that area and there are many more.

## 🔹 Agile Fundamentals

### 🔺 1. Agile Mindset

1. What are some of the challenges with waterfall methods that prompted the software industry to come up with alternatives like agile? Select three.

  - [ ] Projects cost too much
  - [x] Integration issues between different components of the software go undetected for a long time. During the testing phase, when all the components are integrated, these issues are discovered but it is very late in the process.
  > True. Sub-components of software are built in silos and are not integrated till the end. This causes late detection and costly changes in the end.
  - [x] Wrong implementation goes undetected for a long time.
  > True. Since waterfall methods have no way to get early feedback from users, the issues were not getting detected for a long time.
  - [ ] Project teams were geographically distributed.
  - [x] Predicting customer needs is difficult
  > True. One of the issues the software industry saw was that once a product was given to users after several years of development, users responded saying "This is not what I want".

2. What are the four agile values according to the Agile Manifesto?
  
  - [ ] Planning Properly over Just Executing
  - [x] People and Interaction over Processes and tools
  - [x] Responding to Change over Following a plan
  - [x] Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
  - [x] Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation

3. Which of the following statements align with the value "Working software over comprehensive documentation” of Agile manifesto?

  - [ ] Don't do documentation on agile project
  - [ ] Create documentation when it provides value
  - [x] Must write documentation to fulfill company policy
  > True. This aligns with the manifesto. It values documentation but it values delivering software more. In this case, sounds like it is essential for specific reason.

4. Which of the following is true about the Agile Manifesto? Select two.

   - [ ] The Agile Manifesto was primarily based on theoretical knowledge.
   - [x] The Agile Manifesto consists of 4 values and 12 principles.
   - [ ] The Agile Manifesto specifies exact practices and processes that agile teams are expected to follow
   - [x] The Agile Manifesto is work in progress and we are continuing to learn.

5. Why is it difficult to predict user needs and requirements? Select three.

  - [x] Translation issues. Requirements are misinterpreted.
  > True. A lot of times written requirements are misinterpreted by the reader because people have different contexts. It is very difficult to articulate user needs and requirements in words. What you write in the requirements is frequently misinterpreted by the reader
  - [x] Sometimes the market shifts from the time when the requirements were originally defined.
  > True. Sometimes, the needs were spot on when defined, but, during the development process, the market shifted and the user no longer needs the same functionality.
  - [x] Difficult to understand user needs.
  > True. It is very difficult for users / experts to tell what will work / not work for them and the system. Only when they use and play with something (e.g., a prototype), can they tell whether it will work from them.
  - [ ] Not enough time is spent on requirements. If we spend more time early, we can define requirements very accurately.

### 🔺 1. Agile Frameworks and models

1. Which of the following are official rituals/meetings/practices in scrum?

  - [x] Sprint Planning Meeting
  > In scrum, there are four rituals - Sprint planning, Sprint Retrospectives, Sprint Review and Daily Standup.
  - [x] Sprint Retrospective Meeting
  - [ ] Mid-Sprint Status Review Meeting
  - [x] Sprint Review Meeting
  - [x] Daily Scrum Meeting

2. Which of these are core properties of Kanban?

  - [x] Manage Flow
  - [ ] Daily stand-up
  - [x] Visualize the Work
  - [ ] Retrospectives
  - [x] Limit work in progress

Kanban has 5 core properties:
1. Visualize Workflow
2. Limit work-in-progress
3. Measure & Manage Flow
4. Make Process Policies Explicit
5. Use Models to Recognize Improvement Opportunities

[What Is Kanban?](http://www.everydaykanban.com/what-is-kanban/)

3. Which of the following are TRUE about lean startup? Select two.

  - [x] In Lean Startup, you try to validate/invalidate your assumptions (crucial for the success of your product) as fast as you can.
  > True. One way to approach Lean Startup is to list the assumptions that must be true for your product to be successful, then identify how you can measure it and finally conduct an experiment to collect that data so you can validate if your assumption is going to hold true.
  - [ ] The concept of "Validated Learning" in Lean Startup means validating your learning and new ideas with your manager before you implement
  - [ ] Lean Startup concept is primarily applicable to startup companies. It is not applicable for bigger organizations.
  - [x] Lean Startup concepts recommends to go through Build-Measure-Learn cycles as fast as you can.
  > True. The faster you learn, the faster you eliminate waste and pivot your product towards user needs.

4. Which of the following is true about Scrum? Select two.

  - [ ] **In Sprint Retrospective, we talk about what we build, give demo and get customer/client feedback
  > False. In retrospective, we talk about the process and not the product.
  - [x] Burndown and Burnup chart help team track progress of current sprint.
  > True. By graphing the work remaining each day, team can get an idea if they are on track to finish planned work for the sprint.
  - [ ] **In Sprint Review, we talk about process and talk about what was working, what didn't work and how we can improve.
  > False. It is Sprint Retrospective where we talk about process. In Sprint Review we talk about what we built, give demo and get feedback.
  - [ ] In daily stand-up, everybody talks about what they worked, what they are planning to work on and share any impediments they have.
  - [ ] It is encouraged to make iteration scope changes during the sprint

5. Which of the following is true about product and sprint backlogs? Select two.

  - [x] A sprint backlog is created during the sprint planning meeting.
  > Sprint backlog is stories that team decides to work on during the sprint so it is created as a result of sprint planning meeting
  - [x] The product backlog is a prioritized backlog with highest priority items on the top.
  > A good product backlog is kept up to date with highest priority items on the top so team can pick top items from the backlog when they need next thing to work on
  - [ ] Sprint and product backlogs are same thing.
  - [ ] A sprint backlog has all of the items contained in the product backlog.
