# Software Development Models: Agile and Lean

## 🔹 Agile Fundamentals

### 🔺 1. Agile Mindset

1. What are some of the challenges with waterfall methods that prompted the software industry to come up with alternatives like agile? Select three.

  - [ ] Projects cost too much
  - [x] Integration issues between different components of the software go undetected for a long time. During the testing phase, when all the components are integrated, these issues are discovered but it is very late in the process.
  > True. Sub-components of software are built in silos and are not integrated till the end. This causes late detection and costly changes in the end.
  - [x] Wrong implementation goes undetected for a long time.
  > True. Since waterfall methods have no way to get early feedback from users, the issues were not getting detected for a long time.
  - [ ] Project teams were geographically distributed.
  - [x] Predicting customer needs is difficult
  > True. One of the issues the software industry saw was that once a product was given to users after several years of development, users responded saying "This is not what I want".

2. What are the four agile values according to the Agile Manifesto?
  
  - [ ] Planning Properly over Just Executing
  - [x] People and Interaction over Processes and tools
  - [x] Responding to Change over Following a plan
  - [x] Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
  - [x] Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation

3. Which of the following statements align with the value "Working software over comprehensive documentation” of Agile manifesto?

  - [ ] Don't do documentation on agile project
  - [ ] Create documentation when it provides value
  - [x] Must write documentation to fulfill company policy
  > True. This aligns with the manifesto. It values documentation but it values delivering software more. In this case, sounds like it is essential for specific reason.

4. Which of the following is true about the Agile Manifesto? Select two.

   - [ ] The Agile Manifesto was primarily based on theoretical knowledge.
   - [x] The Agile Manifesto consists of 4 values and 12 principles.
   - [ ] The Agile Manifesto specifies exact practices and processes that agile teams are expected to follow
   - [x] The Agile Manifesto is work in progress and we are continuing to learn.

5. Why is it difficult to predict user needs and requirements? Select three.

  - [x] Translation issues. Requirements are misinterpreted.
  > True. A lot of times written requirements are misinterpreted by the reader because people have different contexts. It is very difficult to articulate user needs and requirements in words. What you write in the requirements is frequently misinterpreted by the reader
  - [x] Sometimes the market shifts from the time when the requirements were originally defined.
  > True. Sometimes, the needs were spot on when defined, but, during the development process, the market shifted and the user no longer needs the same functionality.
  - [x] Difficult to understand user needs.
  > True. It is very difficult for users / experts to tell what will work / not work for them and the system. Only when they use and play with something (e.g., a prototype), can they tell whether it will work from them.
  - [ ] Not enough time is spent on requirements. If we spend more time early, we can define requirements very accurately.
