## What software development Looks Like?

1. Which of the two is the software development model that can better respond to changes in the requirements?

    - [x] Agile Model
    - [ ] Waterfall Model
    
2. Which of the two software development model performs the software development activities sequentially in one iteration rather than in increments?

    - [x] Waterfall Model
    - [ ] Agile Model
    
3. Which of the following are the limitations of the waterfall model? Select three.

    - [x] Integration issues may remain undetected until the last phase
    - [x] It is difficult to respond to changes in the requirement
    - [x] Misinterpretations of requirement or design can remain undetected until the later phases
    - [ ] It is not suitable for big projects

## Why do we need requirements?

1. Which is the right description about the requirement specification process?
    - [ ] Requirement specification is a process that identifies and specifies the problem and possible solutions to the problem.
    - [x] Requirement specification is a process to identify and specify the problem to solve.
    - [ ] Requirement specification is a process of solving the requirements.
    - [ ] Requirement specification is a process to design the solution to the problem.
    
2. Specifying requirements is difficult because (select three):
    - [x] The client or end users might not be clear about what they want.
    - [x] Terminology can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the person or the context in which it was used.
    - [ ] There is no guideline for writing a software requirement specification document.
    - [x] Software is intangible, which makes it difficult to comprehend and communicate.

3. Why is requirement specification important? Select two.
    - [x] Repairing an bug in the requirements can cost thousands of times more in the later phases of the software development lifecycle.
    
    > Great! For large projects, erroneous requirements often cost 100 times more to fix later in the lifecycle (although [some](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/costOfChange.htm) can cost 1000 times more, depending on the domain), and for small projects it can be more like 5 times more. Why does it cost so much? Is it just because we have to fix more artifacts (the requirements document, the design document, the code, etc.) or [is there something more](http://www.agile-process.org/change.html)?
    
    - [ ] Changing the requirement is not possible once the system is fully developed.
    - [x] Spending time upfront in requirement specification can save time in the later phases of the software development lifecycle.
