### ðŸ”º Waterfall methods

1. In waterfall method, you get your product in one big bang deployment

  - [x] True
  - [ ] False
  
  > That is true because all of the implementation happens in one shot. Think about what customer sees. Do they get all at once?

2. Sashimi model may help decrease the time duration of the project by

  - [x] Overlapping the phases
  - [ ] Adding more skilled resources of the project
  
  > The main idea behind the Sashimi model is to overlap the phases so that later phases can start before the previous phase ends. This sometimes helps reduce the total project duration. 

3. Which of the following are true for the V-model? Select two.

  - [x] It is a predictive model.
  > The V-model is a predictive model as requirements are expected to be well known earlier in the process and requirement changes are costly in later phases.
  - [x] Testing-related activities are started earlier in the process.
  > In the V-model, we map each of the earlier phases to a later validation phase. This helps get testing activities started earlier in the project's development process.
  - [ ] Requirement changes are welcomed in all phases of this project.
