_________________

### ðŸ”º Waterfall methods

1. In waterfall method, you get your product in one big bang deployment

  - [x] True
  - [ ] False
  
  > That is true because all of the implementation happens in one shot. Think about what customer sees. Do they get all at once?

2. Sashimi model may help decrease the time duration of the project by

  - [x] Overlapping the phases
  - [ ] Adding more skilled resources of the project
  
  > The main idea behind the Sashimi model is to overlap the phases so that later phases can start before the previous phase ends. This sometimes helps reduce the total project duration. 

3. Which of the following are true for the V-model? Select two.

  - [x] It is a predictive model.
  > The V-model is a predictive model as requirements are expected to be well known earlier in the process and requirement changes are costly in later phases.
  - [x] Testing-related activities are started earlier in the process.
  > In the V-model, we map each of the earlier phases to a later validation phase. This helps get testing activities started earlier in the project's development process.
  - [ ] Requirement changes are welcomed in all phases of this project.
  
## ðŸ”¹ Incremental Models

### ðŸ”º Waterfall and Incremental Software Development Models

1. In predictive models, change during the development is expected.

  - [ ] True
  - [x] False
  > Since change is very costly in predictive model, it is not expected.

2. In which of following models, you may end-up building something different than what you originally planned? Select two.

  - [x] Agile models
  > agile mindset recommends that you deliver in short iterations, get regular feedback and make changes based on the feedback.
  - [ ] Waterfall models
  - [x] Adaptive models
  > adaptive models are where you get regular feedback and make changes based on the feedback.
  - [ ] V-Model

3. What are the BENEFITS of the Sashimi Model? Select two.

  - [ ] It supports early validation
  > There is no emphasis on early validation in this model.
  - [x] It can help shorten development time
  > True. By overlapping the phases
  - [x] It can support creating a learning prototype early
  > Since it is possible to overlap requirements, design, and development early, we can potentially work on a prototype early to support learning.

4. Which of the following is true for the V-model? Select two.

  - [x] The V-model is useful in cases where there is ambiguity in requirements and early validation would be useful.
  > True, by including some of the corresponding validation discussions in the early phases, the V-model helps identify issues with requirements early on.
  - [ ] This models emphasizes risk analysis and resolution
  - [ ] In this model, you build software in increments
  - [x] It is a predictive model
  > True. This model assumes that all requirements are known in advance.

5. Which of the following is true for Incremental Models? Select three.

  - [x] You can overlap building of one increment with another
  > True. Overlapping increment development is acceptable in incremental models. For example, you can start defining the requirements of increment 2 while the development of increment 1 is still in progress.
  - [ ] If deploying an increment to actual users can benefit the organization, using an incremental model is a potential candidate to consider.
  > True. This is one of the primary reasons why organizations use incremental models.
  - [ ] Incremental models are always predictive models
  - [ ] You always have to use same model for each of the increments
  > You can use any suitable model for a given increment. For example, in one increment you may use the V-model and for another increment, you may use the Sashimi model.
  - [x] Incremental models may result in rework
  > This is true because in a basic incremental model, you have requirements/design for only the current increment. When you work on a future increment, you may have to change the work done in previous increments as a result of the requirements for the current increment.

6. Which of the following is true for the Waterfall model, V-model and Sashimi model? Select two.

  - [x] In these models, the cost of change depends on how late we find out about the change. If problem requiring a change is found during the implementation phase, it will be more expensive to fix than one found during the design phase.
  > According to the cost of change curve, the later we find a problem requiring a change (a defect/bug), the more costly it is to fix. For example, if we find the change in implementation, it will requires us to redo requirements and design. Whereas if we find change during design phase, we only need to fix the requirements.
  - [x] In these models, we assume that we know requirements really well
  > This is the basis for these models because if you don't know the requirements, it is better to adopt adaptive model that is more conducive to changes later in the development cycle.
  - [ ] In these models, the team is expected know the solution really well.

7. Which model is the best model to use in all situations?

  - [x] None
  > Each model has its place and its pros and cons so there is no one model that will fit all situations
  - [ ] Adaptive since it has most advantages
  - [ ] Waterfall
