## 1. Software Design: Introduction

1. Software design is the process of transforming the stated problem into a ready-to-use implementation.

    - [x] False
    - [ ] True
    > The product of software design is not an actual implementation, but rather a full description of the solution, which can then be used by the code development team.

2. Abstract solutions do not require extensive domain knowledge and effectively reduce the costs during the software design phase.

    - [ ] True
    
    > Domain knowledge is the first and most fundamental necessity in order to achieve quality results during software design (including abstract solutions!).
    
    - [x] False
    
3. It is often advised that abstract solutions do not provide optimization details regarding the implementation.

    - [x] True
    - [ ] False
    
4. When it comes to software design, it is always best to follow a solution that is widely popular in the industry

    - [x] False
    - [ ] True
    
    > **TMTOWDTI** (there's more than one way to do it)!!! There may be many different solutions that can be applied to your specific problem. The most popular solution is always good to consider, but it should not limit the designer's view
    
5. While a solution coming from software design does not include implementation details, there are still common cases where pseudocode may be provided to correctly capture the sense of a complex algorithm.

    - [x] True
    - [ ] False
