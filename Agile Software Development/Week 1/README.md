  - ✅ Incorrect interpretations of requirements by developers go undetected for a long time. During user acceptance tests, these issues are discovered but it is very late.
  > True. Since waterfall methods has no way to get early feedback from users, the issues go undetected for long time.
  - ❌ Projects cost too much
  - ✅ It is difficult to predict user/customer needs
  > True. One of the issues the software industry saw was that once a product was given to users after several years of development, users responded saying "This is not what i want".
  - ✅ Integration issues between different components of the software go undetected for a long time. During the testing phase, when all the components are integrated, these issues are discovered but it is very late in the process.
  > True. Sub-components of software are built in silos and are not integrated till the end. This causes late defect detection and costly changes in the end.
  - ❌ Projects were very complex and big

3. Which Agile Value does the following principle align with:

**_"Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done."_**

  - ✅ Individuals and Interaction Over Process and Tools
  - ❌ Respond to Change Over Following a plan
  - ❌ Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - ❌ Working software over comprehensive documentation
  
  > It is related to investing in people

4. Which of the following align with the agile principle:

**_"Business people and developers work together daily throughout the project."_**

  - ✅ Since agile methodologies do not recommend writing all detailed requirements upfront, it is really important to support greater collaboration between business people and developers so that they can build a shared understanding of what needs to be built.
  - ❌ Business people and developers MUST meet face-to-face daily to clarify confusions, questions etc.
  - ❌ Business people also need to code together with developers to make faster progress.

  > True. Agile methodologies attempt to "[maximize] the amount work not done" and "respond to change" by only writing down what they needs to satisfy the requirements they will be working on in the near-term. Thus, agile teams depend on the business people (e.g., marketing and sales) to communicate customer needs.
